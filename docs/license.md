# Licensing

`MIT License`

**Hiverra Portal** is currently licensed under the MIT License.

## Why MIT?
 * Simplicity: It is a short, permissive license that allows anyone to use, copy, and modify the software.
 * Community Standards: It is the most common license in the Rust and JavaScript ecosystems (e.g., React).
 * Future Proofing: It allows the project to grow freely while ensuring the creator is not liable for how the tool is used.
  
## The Vision
While the core of Portal remains open and permissive, the Hiverra name and brand are reserved for the future organization.
